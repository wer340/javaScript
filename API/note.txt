API
an apllication programming interface (API) is a set of commadnds functions
protocols and objects that programmer can use to create software or interact
with an external system
there certain piece of data that they will allow you to access
but theres other piece of data thats not realy your business
some people will consider to be a contract its a contract between the data 
provider and the developer and essentially it says is these are all the thing
that developers can access and these are the methods the objects the protocols
that you would use to access them and we as the web site that hosts the data 
try to not change any of these methods or functions without notifying you
jquery is api
we are going to use their API as a menu of things that we can do to interact
with their data

2--
Endpoint
paths
parameters
Authentication
each of Api show you each of thing do

Endpoint > every api that interacts with a external system like a server 
will have an endpoint 
https://kanye.rest/
this web site hosts a database of kanye west quotes and we can access the 
data from this web site by using their API and the endpoint of the API
is this  url right here and whenever you are using a different API they are 
going to likely have a different endpoint 
but they will always you what it is in their documention now 
because this  is such a simple API 
if take this url and  i paste it into my browser bar then my browser makes a
get request to the kanye.rest server and they send back a piece of data
which is a quote and it says "blla bllaa" 
path & parameter  theres also API paths and parameter that you can use 
in order to narriw down on a specific of data  you want from an external server
in order to illustrate parts and servers
https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/
black list joke not safe for work   nsfw
https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/programming
now we are inrodusing this consept of paths when  we are trying to access an api
and notice how rhe nedpoint is the url up to that last forward slash [/]
and then if we went down the programming[eaxmple] path
then we would only be getting programming jokes but if change the category to dark
only be getting jokes from the dark category
parametr>
if i wanted to search for a joke that contains a specific word lets say 
i want a programming  joke that contained the word `debugging` 
 well then they proably wouldnt have thought of this of time
they probaly dont have a path to adress this specific query 
so in order to allow the API to be flexible enough to deal with custom queries
like this usually API allow you to provide parameter and parameter the end of url 
after a question mark [?key=query] many query with apersand[&]

monetizable way of api  is Authentication
so every time you make a request through the API they have to be
able to identify you  as developer
and they have to keep track of how often you are using server to get data
and then charge you
https://openweathermap.org/
appid=hash     this parameter for authinticate
order p1&p2&p3  doesnt matter
very difficult test api with browser bar  alot of time edit and adjust
in casuse of  we use postman
return json format 
4---
json
javascript object notation
couple diffrent   object js with json    var lam={} and keyword property object have not ""

make get request external server 
https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/http-requests-in-node-js.html
https native module method  for get data external server
now the thing to remember about this url though is it needs to have the strict
formating the `https://` and then rest of the url  because even though 
we could take this url paste it into browser  and our broswer will automatically
add all the necessary https etc  it doesnt work like that when use our node module
we have to have this first part there
now you can either just paste it into your browser and then select it and copy
it and now when you add this string[endpoint] you will see that its automatically included
that first part[https://] or you  could simply just have typed this as well
it doesnt realy matter
conclusion > in https.get(https//:+url)  first part include while in other case node module not inc;ude

res.stateCode   200 300 400 500 ?? whats happen

res thats get  from parameter callback https.get  
res.on("data"callback(data){})
we can tap into a specific moment say when we recevie some data in the 
response so lets first call the res on when we recive some data .
and im going to create a callback function thats going to contain the data we get 
data packed in hexadecimal code like  ikea flat 
JSON.parse()
JSON.stringfy(object) minimum space similary string

crashed because only one time of res.send in each app.get()

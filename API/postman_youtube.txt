-----
second part
replace manul  test api   automation api
tab test in request box    postman also  code snippet 
that dont have to write code   [code-java-script]

why do you  need parse
the reason for that is what you see here this is json but this 
is essentially just text its not an object that we can use inside java script
so for that reason javascript what we will do is we are going to define
varible  
postman has  varible for global scope top right corner eye icon click
see global variable
book["id"]~ book.id  2 way  current-stock   book["current-stock"]

run all collection
drag tab collection to enviement 
collection runner 
in task  first test   postman.setNextRequest("name other test")
or alternative way  move[drag] test inside collection  
 postman.setNextRequest("null") dont go any here avoid of loop 
monitor your api   that is active >debug hard
usually initail value acces key  not define for secure

and this is pure javascript and its actually a little bit crazy if you
really think about it in order to do something relatively simple
why does it require so many line of code 
and who s going to take care of all our joint pain from all this typing?
this is john resig   had created jquery lib
jQuery("h1")~ $("h1")=document.querySelector("h1")
first lib  add
https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries#jquery cdn
then index.js  add for inject
insurance way  
ready method  
first check jquery lib add then  js customize run
https://www.minifier.org/
minify file reorder  minfy means remove space and comment for reduce size file
browser not care to space 
$("")  select 1  also select many  querySelectorAll and querySelector
addClass() give also many class    hasClass > return false true

now by this point you would have noticed that most of the thing
that you do with jQuery are implemented using method 
before()otline selected tag 
after()  otline selected tag 
prepend() inside selected tag before
append()inside selected tag  after  
remove()  delete element

13----import ES6
better understand what it is that we are doing when we are importing react 
from the react module and how does it actually work behind the scense
export deafult pi;
export {name ,name}
import arbitrray name[deafult],{exact name,exact name} from "./file"
we   can call deafult export with each name but  {name,name}  must be
write exactlly same thing  

import React from "react"
var React =require("react")
same   both correct
this require function actually come from Node itself not javascript
use  ES6 because the browser penetration of ES6 is something like 80%at the moment
so that mean 80% can render
you can use wildcard   import * from "./file"
15---- setup  react
a.check node is up to date
b.install vscode
c.creat react app   > npx create-react-app  name project
d.run

express()  make object then listen method 
now a port is basically just a channel that we have tuned our server to
so for example sometimes i listen to radio and i tun my radio
 to listen to 104.9FM
and our server is just tuned into the channel 3000
now not much is happening here so let stop our server and we do that by going
into the command line  ctrl+c exit
so if we wanted to be  able to see when our port is set up and when our server
is runing we can add a callback function to this method 
//localhost:3000  can not get
so this [/] just represents localhost:3000/,which is the route or the home page
app.get
and this is a method thats provided by express that allow us to specify
what should happen when a browser gets in touch with our server a get request
first parameter it takes is  the location of the get request

1----  representional state  transfer
client and server talk together with specifiec lang
thats lang is http request and ftp
if talk to server to other lang  server dont understand ypur lang
http hyper text transfer protocol    secure
in order to give us that result the server do one of two things  
it might do some computation run some code to work  out result that
might need to communicate to databse in order to grab the relevent
piece of data that client requested  
also there only a certain amount of thing that the server can do 
example resturant  you would have a menu of items that thid particular
resaurant would serve
the server will have a bunch of API which are services that it
can expose for client be able to tap into 
so when we are building an api we are kind of like building the menu
of thing that our server can respond 
--> api usage   api build  this topic api build 
client  dont send every req with every job
now that we understand all there component what does it mean to make 
our API RESTful ?
well REST is essentially just an architectural style
REST is an architetural style for designing API and its definitly not only
architectural  so the other realy realy popular one before REST  became 
the dominant style was SOAP   other name FALCOR and  GraphQL
but the gold standard for web API is REST
rest from   part of phd guys Roy Fielding california university
every web API was built using the same common guiding principle
then it would be so easy for everybody to work together and be able
to use different APIs quickly easily and efficiently
so  follow two imortant rule
1-use http request verbs
GET POST PATCH PUT DELETE
might  realize that they have alot of similarity to something 
data base module CRUD
2-use specific pattern of route /endpoint URLs

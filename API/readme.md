an apllication programming interface (API) is a set of commadnds functions
protocols and objects that programmer can use to create software or interact
with an external system
there certain piece of data that they will allow you to access
but theres other piece of data thats not realy your business
some people will consider to be a contract its a contract between the data 
provider and the developer and essentially it says is these are all the thing
that developers can access and these are the methods the objects the protocols
that you would use to access them and we as the web site that hosts the data 
try to not change any of these methods or functions without notifying you
jquery is api
we are going to use their API as a menu of things that we can do to interact
with their data

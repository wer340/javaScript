dom
manipulate tag html   first inject
html an css   after user click a button changes css and html then 
reload page  if imossible and its a nightmare if so many people 
do same thing
dom slove this issue  dom catalog of html into invidiual object
that we can select and manipulate 
now the task converting html file into dom is done by the browser
when you load web page and it what does that it turn each of these 
element and thier associated data into a tree structure with a whole
 bunch of objects you can select and manipulate
tree model   with all realtionship mapped on digram
head descend of html  and head and body sibiling
+++
and eveything taht is contained inside your html document is contained
in a n object called document 
-----html tree generator plugin  chrome
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-tree-generator/dlbbmhhaadfnbbdnjalilhdakfmiffeg/related
inside dom  can have  property and method
property  describe about object and method are thing  that the object
can do
  //4 property  with dot see property  car examp door seat  method drive brake ..
car.numbersDoor;//expext number ++ also set property car.numbersDoor=2
when call method like drive on car

css property  font-size    > js camel case  convetion    fontSize
background-color backgroundColor
Style Object Properties
https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp
css for style  js for interactive  html for content
dont should  js for style  only  change on fly
like click then bgColor changed

our style actually should be inside  css but problem is  that if we wanted
our style to change on the fly say if a user click on a button  then
the color of the background change then we kind of need to change that 
using js and the style property right? as with all thing programming
there s usually another way  and its usually better
 now one of the thing that we can tap into is something called a class list
and its a property of every dom object
##classList list of class that are attached to this element the we found
after  with method add()    add a class property
leading to   principle   css insid css  js insid js and ..
another property  ##textContent   for manipulate 
innerHtml  give between elemnt  <strong>hello</strong>
but textContent  give text not give tag strong and ..
last way for manipulate  ##attribute
.attributes  its  < tag till >   every thing attribute
.getAtrributes()
.setAttributes()

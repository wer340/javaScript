1--- react  aa java script library
vastly simplfy  structure 
<body>
<MyHeader />
<PageContent />
<MyFooter />
</body>
✔component
that previosly we haave always tried to keep our HTML css js  seprate .But react does and what it realy benefits from is actually 
combining small amount of each of these type of file into a single component so that each component has its own styling 
its own functionality that it controls  and you can create several of these component to each perform a different function and have
a different apperance 
these days component handled and updating itself and its own appearance and data being able to talk to the server independently
react keep old  dom  and look diffrence between old dom  and new dom then re render this feature thats changed  
✅react is not the only frontend framwork out there

change font   console     this app similar  to vscode

index.html is entry point   by convention we alwayse create a div html element that has an id of root 
and this is basically the root of your react application
everything that we create using react is going to be inserted inside this div 
in bottom also  index.js exist  

min needed  t implent react  react  and  reac-dom

reactDom.render("what  show ","where put ")      ~ --> (<h1>hello</h1>,document.getElementById("root"))
notice  script index.js    add to index.html
inject ele,ent tag to html file 
✅we are able to write plain HTML without any sort of fancy angle brackets or for example  the ejs bracket or anything 
to denote that this somehow not javascript so waht exactly is this magic ?
well this is what jsx does. react works by creating these jsx files so files where we have got HTML right in the body of a 
javascript file and what happened behind the  scenes is that our HTML is picked up by a compiler  and gets converted or
compiled down to actual javascript  and comiler come from including this react module right here 
so you can  see that if i go heaad and comment this out[require("react")] then we are going to be geting some major problems 
so inside the react module there is something called Babel . and babel[aprounn : bybel] , as they tell you is a javaScript compiler
so its aable to take next genration javascript  like es6 , 7, 8  and compile it down that every browser acan understand
and this include compiling jsx down to plain old javascript 
  https://babeljs.io/repl  try out
ReactDom.render( /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement("h1", null, "hello world"), document.getElementById("root"));
convert down javascript
✅✅so  import    reactdom  from react-dom   by using  import and the export keyword we are able to modularise these dependency
far better  we end up with code thats better organizaed 
single html element handle  by arg render if have two element  put this div element then work this code

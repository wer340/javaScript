main diffent between database  
sql base  or no sql base
structure query language  older than rather nosql 
not only structure query language
my sql  postgresql 
mongo db  redis
and all people confuse to when   to use  which and what are 
similarties and differencess and how do you choose anyway
talk about   sql and nosql
first diffrence in structure 
relation sql
non-relation  nosql 

instead you have to know your particular situstion is to choose the 
right database

nosql   is scalblity this is a real strong point of db
its  data getting large  data base slower
nosql  use json  use small space of resource

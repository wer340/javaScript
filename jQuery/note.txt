and this is pure javascript and its actually a little bit crazy if you
really think about it in order to do something relatively simple
why does it require so many line of code 
and who s going to take care of all our joint pain from all this typing?
this is john resig   had created jquery lib
jQuery("h1")~ $("h1")=document.querySelector("h1")

node dijango      Job Trends from indeed.com
so we have talked about why we want to use node 
but what exactly does it do anyway?
well currently in our web sites we have written javascript code and we have
been able to execute it inside our browser nut realy important
but up untill now that javascript code has been locked behind
bars and kept inside the browser only been able to interact with browser 
request information from the browser add event listener to components in
the browser but we have not able to write javascript code for our website
thats able to go beyond the boundaries of the browser
basiclly you nees to be able to write code can interact directly with the 
computer independent of the browser and thats exactly what node.js allows us to
do it allows us to take javascript out of browser and it liberated it
allowing it to interact directly with the hardware of a computer
so we can now use js inside our web site in order to give it functionality and 
behavior 
for example implementing animation or dropdown menu
but node allow us to use js to interact directly with the hardware of 
the computer . so we can use it for example to create a desktop application
and in fact atom the code editor that we have been using all of this time 
is based on node js 
so now with node js you can write js code not just in browser to affect behavior
of your website but also write full application that work on your computer

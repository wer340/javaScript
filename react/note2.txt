13----import ES6
better understand what it is that we are doing when we are importing react 
from the react module and how does it actually work behind the scense
export deafult pi;
export {name ,name}
import arbitrray name[deafult],{exact name,exact name} from "./file"
we   can call deafult export with each name but  {name,name}  must be
write exactlly same thing  

import React from "react"
var React =require("react")
same   both correct
this require function actually come from Node itself not javascript
use  ES6 because the browser penetration of ES6 is something like 80%at the moment
so that mean 80% can render
you can use wildcard   import * from "./file"
15---- setup  react
a.check node is up to date
b.install vscode
c.creat react app   > npx create-react-app  name project
d.run
19----props
this feture simalar to html attribute
in element  <input  value=""  name=""  placehollder=""   >
with such a way can   declare <Heading  name="" tell="" />
for recive    in componennent  
function Heading(props){
<h1>{props.tell}</h1>  
props a object thats keeping hold all attribute stick to componnent

20----practise
make a data   [{},{},{},{}]
statement not work inside html 
<Imgbox  name="{item.name}"  />
how itrate array  in  <Imgbox name="{item.name}"/>   for if  while is statement not work
21----devtools
we want to make componnent reusable  so as much as  thats allow me   we make is smaller than
in this  way  we handle componnent inside to other one  
<Box name= src= >
function Box(props){
<Imgbox  src=props.src >
}
function Imgbox(props){
	<img  src=props.src >
}
this way proably confusing  so  use  devtools react  thats like inspect Element but show you 
react componnent 

installl react devtools  chrome extensions
if < >  in componnet section  can see componnent sourcecode 

22----- maping
for get out repeat
contacts[0].name
contacts[1].name
contacts[2].name
we hanlde with function
<app />
function createImg(item){
return (<Imgbox
 src={item.src}
name={item.name}	
/>)
}
function App(){
return(
list.map(createImg)
)
}
==>notice this way  
how in the console we are actually getting a warning here and this warning doesnt go away
 warning tell us is taht each child in a list should have a unique key property
this is realy important point remember how in begining i said that react is able to create 
a virtual DOM  that represents current appearance of your website and for it to be able 
to efficiently render components for every single componnent thats being renderd
using a loop such as the map function we will have to give those componnent a property has 
to be called key . and this property has to be something that is unique amongst each of 
these card componnent thats being created using this loop

23-----practise mapping
